                Allow me to tell you a little about myself. I'm a California-native with a passion for everything languages.  
                It began as an interest in French, specifically. From there it moved to Spanish, then German, then Arabic. Something about 
                the way they standardized thoughts. The way you learned rules only to then bend and (*gasp*) break them. How then, did a linguaphile 
                get into software engineering?
            </p><p>
                I had a terrible experience with a developer. I had an idea for a phone app, and I hired a developer. He did quite a bit right 
                I now realize (specifically with the HTML), but the functionality was off. In short, he eventually couldn't do any more for 
                the project, and so I hired a different developer. This developer was amazing. The app was up and running and (as near as) perfect 
                as an app can get. As he went along though, he would offer little tidbits here or there about what had gone wrong. As I listened, 
                I found my interest piqued.
            </p><p>
                Finally wanting to understand a little more, I asked this developer how he got into it. He introduced me to CS50. The program 
                was arguably one of the most challenging things I'd done, but what struck me was exactly how <em>like languages it was.</em> 
                They both had the same sort of logic and rules. Admittedly, the compiler (I was writing in C) was far less forgiving than any 
                listener was, but still. There was the same elegance; the same way that smaller elements were put together into larger constructs. 
                When you needed to solve a problem (or, in linguistics, express a concept), there were a multitude of ways. You just had to employ 
                what you know and get creative.
            </p>
            <p>
                From there, I continued to learn in C, eventually going as far as creating hash tables and linked lists, before moving on to Python, 
                a little in SQL, a <em>very</em> little in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After that, I applied to Flatiron to continue that educations. 
                And that about catches us up.
